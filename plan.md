# Assassin / Hitman Oneshot(?)

#### Players will act as a party of assassins who have been hired to take a hit out on someone. They must start by tracking down a messenger who slipped away from the Viscount and gathering their final clue for where the Baron was traveling next on his trip to gather more materials.

## Setup
The (player's) assassin group, known as Veilwalkers, has been hired by a wealthy local Viscount named Astosor Ilospurde, who is looking to take out a rival Baron named Aradmon Mospartamun, who is looking to gain political advantage through their sales of various tinctures. Baron Mospartamun is a well known Alchemist and Sorcerer who is well versed in herbs and flowers across the local landscape, which has led to great financial success for him while scouting and raiding against various new "dungeons" have begun gaining tractions amongst the Adventurer's population. Not many have learned the arts of potion crafting, but those who have make quite a pretty penny. Though the Viscount has a good working relation with a few potion crafters, this Baron has entered his territory and is not only selling potions for cheaper, but has also stood firmly against the Viscount for nearly 2 decades since first gaining his title. Your job is to take out the Baron while he is out gathering herbs and flowers, and to steal his family seal, which is carried on his person, to prevent the rest of his family from regaining status within the Dukedom. The Viscount has no plans to touch or harm the rest of the family should you finish your job in a clean manner, though he does warn that you should take some care as the Baron himself is a rather skilled mage, and tends to bring some swordsmen bodyguards around when he is gathering materials. That rat was always cautious with his defenses.... which is why the Viscount has led himself to your group.

## General Information For Players
You will all be seasoned characters with 6 total advancements, This will (unfortunately) be an all-human group, so you will be humans Rank Seasoned 3. The materials for this will be [Savage Worlds Core Rulebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18PLbw2WheFH1n9rGLae7dLc-P4muhiMc/view), along with [Pathfinder Core Rulebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lVpF_FuD-n1idbxHJ0tU9g4q0znLnlaJ/view), [Pathfinder Advanced Player Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pg5DyNaXC63pvwb5oehgbRyP6IXvMGVc/view), [Pathfinder Companion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MPOq5ys8jhdgdgAqqMZCoYd_unEHyLhz/view). If you would like to build a character, feel free to use the provided sources. Otherwise, as is tradition in these shorter style shots, I will have some premade characters available who will be considered part of the troupe, and simply not partaking in the assignment should they not be chosen.

This setting will take place within a Dukedom in the Kingdom of Udirquab, in the Dukedom of Samasthomod. Duke Estioli Samasthomod is well known for their knowledge in medicine and healing magic, and as such is very well known to have the largest variety of plants and other materials for medicines and potions. The information your group has gotten this far is a piece of battered parchment one of your troupe members stole from a messenger found traveling near the Viscount's estate who, when interrogated, chose to bite his tongue rather than tell you about their plans. Unfortunately for him, the parchment seems to be familiar within the nobility, and as such the Viscount may have some information to give you a lead in order to more easily find the Baron while he is still in search of his goal.

##### You may pick the alchemist class but for in-world reasons I will not be allowing the brewing of specifically items which heal due to the supposed rarity of the potioncraft. All other items will be left available so long as they are not trapped as a potion, the effects may stay the same.

## Lore Notes
- Healing potion production is not a common practice. While the gods do allow people to channel their energy, in any pantheon within the realms, the gods have forbidden the storage of their gifts, as it may be used by ne'er-do-wells for nefarious acts in opposition to their ideals. As such any healing potion must be created by extreme specialists. Magic is much like blood types where healing with it requires a specific reasonance in order to be successful, lest it lead to some form of backlash depending on the level of compatability. Only those of a specific magical quality may use it, and it requires more precision than typical alchemical brewing in order to get a successful result from the process.

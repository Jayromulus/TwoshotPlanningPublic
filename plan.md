# Assassin / Hitman Twoshot

#### Players will act as a party of assassins who have been hired to take a hit out on someone. They must start by tracking down a messenger who slipped away from the Viscount and gathering their final clue for where the Baron was traveling next on his trip to gather more materials.

## Setup
The (player's) assassin group, known as Veilwalkers, has been hired by a wealthy local Viscount who is looking to take out a rival Baron who is looking to gain political advantage through their sales of various tinctures. The Baron is a well known Alchemist and Sorcerer who is well versed in herbs and flowers across the local landscape, which has led to great financial success for him while scouting and raiding against various new "dungeons" have begun gaining tractions amongst the Adventurer's population. Not many have learned the arts of potion crafting, but those who have make quite a pretty penny. Though the Viscount has a good working relation with a few potion crafters, this Baron has entered his territory and is not only selling potions for cheaper, but has also stood firmly against the Viscount for nearly 2 decades since first gaining his title. Your job is to take out the Baron while he is out gathering herbs and flowers, and to steal his family seal, which is carried on his person, to prevent the rest of his family from regaining status within the Dukedom. The Viscount has no plans to touch or harm the rest of the family should you finish your job in a clean manner, though he does warn that you should take some care as the Baron himself is a rather skilled mage, and tends to bring some swordsmen bodyguards around when he is gathering materials. That rat was always cautious with his defenses.... which is why the Viscount has led himself to your group.
